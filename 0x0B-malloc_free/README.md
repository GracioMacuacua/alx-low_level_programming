### Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:


* What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
* What is ``malloc`` and ``free`` and how to use them
* Why and when use ``malloc``
* How to use ``valgrind`` to check for memory leak

### [0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee ](./0-create_array.c)
* A function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

### [ 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings ](./1-strdup.c)
* A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

### [ 2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life ](./2-str_concat.c)
* A function that concatenates two strings.

### [3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize ](./3-alloc_grid.c)
* a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

### [ 4. It's not bragging if you can back it up ](./4-free_grid.c)
* A function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

### [5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe ](./100-argstostr.c)
